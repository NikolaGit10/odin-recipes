    <h2>About moussaka</h2>
    <p>Moussaka (/muːˈsɑːkə/, UK also /ˌmuːsəˈkɑː/, US also /ˌmuːsɑːˈkɑː/) is an eggplant (aubergine)- or potato-based
        dish, often including ground meat, which is common in the Balkans and the Middle East, with many local and
        regional variations.
    </p>
    <p>The modern Greek variant was created in the 1920s by Nikolaos Tselementes.[citation needed] Many versions have a
        top layer made of milk-based sauce thickened with egg (custard) or flour (béchamel sauce). In Greece, the dish
        is layered and typically served hot. Tselementes also proposed a vegan variant for orthodox fast days. Romania
        also has a vegan version that replaces meat with mushrooms or a mix of sautéed onions and rice.

        <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>0.75 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 tbsp (60g) butter</li>
        <li>50 g plain flour</li>
        <li>625 ml milk</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp nutmeg, freshly grated (optional)</li>
        <li>50 g parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1.25 tsp Vegeta, vegetable or chicken stock powder</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>20 g panko breadcrumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place eggplant slightly overlapping in a large colander. Sprinkle with some salt. Repeat with remaining eggplant.</li>
        <li>Leave to sweat for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make Meat Sauce and Béchamel Sauce.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 240C/450F. </li>
        <li>Pat eggplant dry - make sure to do this well, otherwise it's too salty. Lay on parchment paper lined trays (you might need 3 trays, work in batches), brush with oil.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 - 20 minutes or until lightly browned and softened . Remove and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or pot over high heat, then cook the garlic and onion for 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the beef or lamb and cook until it changes from pink to brown, breaking it up as you go.</li>
        <li>Add wine, cook for 1.5 minutes or until alcohol smell is gone.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer, then lower heat to medium low and cook for 15 minutes, or until reduced to a thick sauce.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a pan over medium heat. Add flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Stirring constantly, slowly add the milk. Then stir regularly for 3 to 5 minutes or until it thickens so that it thickly coats the back of a wooden spoon (see video / step photos).</li>
        <li>Remove from the stove and whisk in cheese, nutmeg, Vegeta/stock powder (or salt) and pepper.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then whisk the eggs in. Cover with lid until required.</li>
        <li>Lower oven to 180C/350F (all oven types).</li>
        <li>Place half the eggplant in the bottom of a baking dish (I used my 26cm/9" Lodge skillet), then top with all the Filling.</li>
        <li>Top with remaining eggplant, then pour over the Béchamel Sauce, sprinkle with breadcrumbs. </li>
        <li>Bake for 30 - 40 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
